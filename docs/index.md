  Provider for generating standardized Azure resource names following naming conventions.
  This provider helps maintain consistent resource naming across your Azure infrastructure by providing configurable templates
  and functions for generating resource names. It supports both global resources and child resources, with configurable
  separators, random suffixes, and instance numbers.
  Why is this provider needed?
  When working with Azure, maintaining consistent resource naming is critical. This provider makes it easy to align resource names to organizational standards with minimal input from developers.
  A key advantage of this provider is that generated resource names are stored in Terraform state. This means your resource names remain stable even when naming conventions or input parameters change. Since Azure treats resource names as immutable identifiers, simple changes to name generation logic can trigger destructive rebuilds that cascade across your infrastructure. By persisting names in state, this provider protects you from unintended resource recreation and the associated downtime and data loss.
  What about azurecaf_name?
  The azurecaf https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aztfmod/azurecaf/latest provider actually inspired the creation of this provider! However I wasn't satisfied with the functionality and ease of use of the azurecaf_name data source. I found that it was not flexible enough for my needs and I wanted to have more control over the naming process. It also does not persist naming in state, which is a key advantage of this provider.

# azname Provider

Provider for generating standardized Azure resource names following naming conventions.

This provider helps maintain consistent resource naming across your Azure infrastructure by providing configurable templates
and functions for generating resource names. It supports both global resources and child resources, with configurable
separators, random suffixes, and instance numbers.

### Why is this provider needed?

When working with Azure, maintaining consistent resource naming is critical. This provider makes it easy to align resource names to organizational standards with minimal input from developers. 

A key advantage of this provider is that generated resource names are **stored in Terraform state**. This means your resource names remain stable even when naming conventions or input parameters change. Since Azure treats resource names as immutable identifiers, simple changes to name generation logic can trigger destructive rebuilds that cascade across your infrastructure. By persisting names in state, this provider protects you from unintended resource recreation and the associated downtime and data loss.

### What about azurecaf_name?

The [azurecaf](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aztfmod/azurecaf/latest) provider actually inspired the creation of this provider! However I wasn't satisfied with the functionality and ease of use of the azurecaf_name data source. I found that it was not flexible enough for my needs and I wanted to have more control over the naming process. It also does not persist naming in state, which is a key advantage of this provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic provider configuration with default settings
provider "azname" {
  # Separator character used between name components (default: "-")
  separator = "-"

  # Length of random suffix appended to names (1-6, default: 3)
  random_length = 4

  # Length of instance number padding (1-6, default: 3)
  # With instance_length = 3, instance 1 becomes "001"
  instance_length = 3

  # Remove special characters to ensure Azure naming compliance (default: true)
  clean_output = true

  # Trim names to fit within Azure resource length limits (default: true)
  trim_output = true
}

# Advanced provider configuration with prefixes and suffixes
# These will be applied to all generated names
provider "azname" {
  separator     = "-"
  random_length = 4

  # Global prefixes applied to all resource names
  prefixes = ["corp", "az"]

  # Global suffixes applied to all resource names
  suffixes = ["001"]

  # Custom templates for name generation (advanced usage)
  # Use ~ as placeholder for the separator character
  # Default template: {prefix}~{resource_type}~{workload}~{environment}~{service}~{location}{instance}{rand}~{suffix}
  template = "{prefix}~{resource_type}~{workload}~{environment}~{location}{rand}"

  # Template for child resources (default: {parent_name}~{resource_type}{instance}~{rand})
  template_child = "{parent_name}~{resource_type}~{workload}{rand}"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `clean_output` (Boolean) Remove special characters from generated names to ensure compatibility with Azure naming rules.
- `instance_length` (Number) Length of instance number padding in generated names. Must be between 1 and 6.
- `prefixes` (List of String) List of prefixes to prepend to resource names. These will be joined using the separator character.
- `random_length` (Number) Length of random suffix to append to generated names. Must be between 1 and 6.
- `separator` (String) Character to use as separator in resource names. Must be a single character.
- `suffixes` (List of String) List of suffixes to append to resource names. These will be joined using the separator character.
- `template` (String) Global template for resource name generation. Uses ~ as a placeholder for the separator character.
- `template_child` (String) Template for child resource name generation. Uses ~ as a placeholder for the separator character.
- `trim_output` (Boolean) Trim generated names to fit Azure resource length limits while preserving important parts.
