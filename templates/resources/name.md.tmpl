# {{.Type}}: {{.Name}}

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

This resource uses templates to generate consistent resource names based on inputs like workload name,
environment, resource type, and location. It supports both global resources and child resources.

The `azname_name` resource persists generated names in Terraform state. This means that once a name is generated, it remains stable even if naming conventions or input parameters change. This is crucial for Azure resources, as their names are immutable identifiers. By storing names in state, this resource helps prevent unintended resource recreation and the associated downtime and data loss.
