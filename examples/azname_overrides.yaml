# azname_overrides.yaml
# 
# This file allows you to customize the azname provider's resource slugs and region shortnames
# to match your organization's naming standards. Place this file in your Terraform project root.
#
# The provider will automatically discover this file in the current directory:
# - ./azname_overrides.yaml

# Override resource slugs (CAF prefixes) for existing resources
# Use this to change the default abbreviations to match your naming conventions
resource_slug_overrides:
  # Example: Change "rg" to "azrg"
  azurerm_resource_group: "azrg"
  
  # Example: Change "st" to "sto"
  azurerm_storage_account: "sto"
  
  # Example: Change "kv" to "vault"
  azurerm_key_vault: "vault"
  
  # Example: Change "vnet" to "net"
  azurerm_virtual_network: "net"
  
  # Add more overrides as needed...

# Override region shortnames for existing Azure regions
# The key can be the CLI name, full name, or existing short name
region_shortname_overrides:
  # Example: Override "East US" to use "use" instead of default "eus"
  eastus: "use"
  
  # Example: Override "West US 2" to use "usw2" instead of default "wus2"
  westus2: "usw2"
  
  # Example: Override "Australia East" to use "aue" instead of default "ae"
  australiaeast: "aue"
  
  # Add more overrides as needed...

# Define completely new resources not yet supported by the provider
# This allows you to use the provider for custom or newly released Azure resources
new_resources:
  # Example: Define a custom resource type
  azurerm_custom_resource:
    slug: "custom"           # Resource abbreviation/prefix
    min_length: 1            # Minimum name length
    max_length: 63           # Maximum name length
    scope: "resourceGroup"   # Where the name must be unique: "global", "resourceGroup", or "parent"
    dashes: true             # Whether dashes are allowed in the name
    lowercase: true          # Whether the name should be lowercase
  
  # Example: Define a new Azure resource not yet in the provider
  azurerm_app_configuration:
    slug: "appconfig"
    min_length: 5
    max_length: 50
    scope: "global"          # App Configuration names are globally unique
    dashes: true
    lowercase: true
  
  # Add more custom resources as needed...

# Define completely new regions not yet supported by the provider
# Useful for new Azure regions or custom/private cloud locations
new_regions:
  # Example: Define a custom region
  customregion:
    cli_name: "customregion"        # CLI name (used in Azure CLI/API)
    full_name: "Custom Region"      # Full display name
    short_name: "cust"              # Short name for name generation
  
  # Example: Define a new Azure region not yet in the provider
  mexiconorth:
    cli_name: "mexiconorth"
    full_name: "Mexico North"
    short_name: "mexn"
  
  # Add more custom regions as needed...
